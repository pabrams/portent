## Package and publish your very own VS Code theme

A long time ago, in a land far, far away, there was a game called Trade Wars 2002 on all the bulletin board systems. It was an ansi game, mostly text based but with the occasional ascii-art graphic. I'd spend a great deal of time entering commands into a console to play the game: trading commodities at starports, colonizing planets, and engaging in space combat with alien bots or other players. It was a great game, and I played it for years. It had a distinctive color scheme: All primary and secondary colors, each in two intensities, as well as white and black. It was aesthetically appealing, the designers having done a great job of pairing complementary colours (green with magenta, red with cyan, and blue with yellow). It only used those twelve colours on an ink-black background, and almost never using white.

Today, I still love that color scheme, and it's what I always try to reproduce when I customize my user interfaces.

Here are the colours, including black and white:

Here's a shot of my VS Code instance, with my Trade Wars 2002 theme applied, as I write this blog:

Although I published the colour theme, it's not really finished. I want to replace the white and grey with something else, and some of my choices are too low-contrast, making them hard to work with.
